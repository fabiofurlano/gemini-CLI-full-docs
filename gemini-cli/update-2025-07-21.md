# Gemini CLI Recent Update Highlights (July 9, 2025 to Present) [​](https://gemini-cli.xyz/docs/en/update-2025-07-21\#gemini-cli-recent-update-highlights-july-9-2025-to-present)

We are excited to announce a series of significant updates to Gemini CLI designed to enhance your development efficiency and user experience.

### Key Highlights of This Update [​](https://gemini-cli.xyz/docs/en/update-2025-07-21\#key-highlights-of-this-update)

- **IDE Integration (VS Code & Zed)**: You can now deeply integrate Gemini CLI with your editor. Through the new VS Code companion extension, Gemini can use the files you're currently editing as context, making conversations and coding smarter and more efficient. We've also added initial support for the Zed editor.
- **New `/copy` Command**: This is a highly practical feature for frequent use. You can now copy the complete output of your last interaction to the clipboard with one click, whether it's code blocks or model responses, making sharing and usage incredibly convenient.
- **Enhanced UI Experience and Customization**: We've introduced custom theme functionality and optimized the light theme. Additionally, list selection, command auto-completion, and cursor behavior have all been improved for a smoother overall interaction experience.
- **Enhanced Configuration Capabilities**: Added support for `.geminiignore` files, allowing you to precisely control which files Gemini CLI cannot access, just like using `.gitignore`. We've also added system-level configuration, proxy settings, and other advanced options.

### Detailed Update Notes [​](https://gemini-cli.xyz/docs/en/update-2025-07-21\#detailed-update-notes)

#### 1\. IDE Integration [​](https://gemini-cli.xyz/docs/en/update-2025-07-21\#_1-ide-integration)

- **VS Code Companion Extension**: We've released a VS Code extension that allows Gemini CLI to safely detect the active files you have open in your editor. This enables Gemini to provide more accurate context when offering code suggestions and answering questions.
- **New `/ide` Command Set**: Through commands like `/ide status` and `/ide install`, you can easily manage and configure editor integration.
- **Zed Editor Support**: We've begun integrating with Zed and can now detect and interact with the Zed editor.

#### 2\. Command and Interaction Optimization [​](https://gemini-cli.xyz/docs/en/update-2025-07-21\#_2-command-and-interaction-optimization)

- **`/copy` Command**: Use `/copy` to quickly copy Gemini's complete last response to the clipboard.
- **Command System Refactoring**: We've performed a major refactoring of the underlying slash command system. Almost all commands (such as `/auth`, `/theme`, `/tools`, `/extensions`, etc.) have been migrated to the new architecture. This brings more consistent, reliable, and faster command execution.
- **Command Completion**: Optimized command triggering and auto-completion logic, making Tab key completion smarter.
- **Interactive Diff Confirmation**: When confirming or rejecting a code modification suggestion, you can now see a clear `diff` view, making decisions more intuitive.

#### 3\. User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) [​](https://gemini-cli.xyz/docs/en/update-2025-07-21\#_3-user-experience-ux-and-user-interface-ui)

- **Custom Themes**: You can now create and use personalized CLI themes according to your preferences!
- **UI Detail Polish**:
  - Improved color contrast for the light theme.
  - The cursor automatically hides when the terminal window loses focus, reducing distractions.
  - Added number shortcuts for list selection (such as file selection) and optimized arrow navigation.
  - Support for directly pasting images from clipboard on macOS.

#### 4\. Configuration and Control [​](https://gemini-cli.xyz/docs/en/update-2025-07-21\#_4-configuration-and-control)

- **`.geminiignore` Support**: Create a `.geminiignore` file in your project root directory or user home directory to exclude files and directories you don't want Gemini CLI to access. The rules are similar to `.gitignore`.
- **Global Configuration**: System administrators can now set global configuration files to uniformly manage Gemini CLI behavior across teams or organizations.
- **Network Proxy**: Added explicit `--proxy` command-line option for convenient use in environments requiring proxy settings.

#### 5\. Authentication and Security [​](https://gemini-cli.xyz/docs/en/update-2025-07-21\#_5-authentication-and-security)

- **Non-interactive Environment Authentication**: Improved authentication flow in environments where browsers cannot be opened (such as SSH, Docker containers), now automatically falling back to manual device code authentication flow.
- **OAuth Flow Enhancement**: Optimized OAuth callback logic to better support authentication within Docker containers.

#### 6\. Performance and Stability [​](https://gemini-cli.xyz/docs/en/update-2025-07-21\#_6-performance-and-stability)

- **Startup Acceleration**: By moving tasks like model availability checks to background execution, we've reduced CLI startup time.
- **Loop Detection**: Introduced preliminary loop detection mechanisms that can identify and interrupt simple repetitive operations, preventing accidental resource consumption.
- **Bug Fixes**: Fixed numerous known issues, including but not limited to: rendering crashes caused by ANSI escape characters, GitIgnore parsing errors in specific situations, Markdown rendering format issues, etc. Overall stability has been significantly improved.

We hope these updates bring you a better experience!
